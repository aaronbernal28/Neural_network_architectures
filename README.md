# Neural_network_architectures

This repository contains implementations of various neural network architectures in Python using only Numpy. It is based on the book `O. Cailin, Deep learning architectures - a mathematical approach, Springer Series in the Data Sciences, 2020` and the course `Fundamentos matem√°ticos del aprendizaje profundo` from DM-UBA (2C. 2025).
Test and examples are provided in Jupyter notebooks.
